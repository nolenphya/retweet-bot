##  Usage

```
Retweet bot is a bot that will retweet-tweets based on sentiment analysis
```

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install textblob
pip install tweepy
```

Now, if you haven't at this point, you will need to get your developer account & API key. There are much better guides on that which already exist. Here's a start: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a 

Once you have set up the account and figured out your keys, download the retweet-bot folder. Set it as your working directory in whatever environment you're using. 

Copy paste your API keys into the placeholders in the retweet.py file using whatever code editor you're using. 

With that set up you should be good to start spamming that retweet button!

Start retweeting by typing in your terminal:

```bash
Python retweet.py
```
## Usage

```python

Python retweet.py ## Will find as many tweets as you specify in the code and then retweet based on given sentiment parameters.

```

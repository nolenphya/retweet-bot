##  Usage

```
Retweet bot is a bot that will retweet-tweets based on sentiment analysis
```

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install textblob
pip install tweepy
```

Now, if you haven't at this point, you will need to get your developer account & API key. There are much better guides on that which already exist. Here's a start: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a 

Once you have set up the account and figured out your keys, download the retweet-bot folder. Set it as your working directory in whatever environment you're using. 

Copy paste your API keys into the placeholders in the retweet.py file using whatever code editor you're using. 

With that set up you should be good to start spamming that retweet button!

```bash
Python retweet.py
```
## Usage

Once you have fully installed everything all you need to do now is go to your terminal and type:

```python

Python retweet.py ## Will find as many tweets as you specify in the code and then retweet based on given sentiment parameters.

```

## Contributing
For changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Updates

This is a start of a larger project. I will continue to develop this bot with the eventual goal of making everything more user friendly to the point anyone could pick it up and start using it provided they have a Twitter developer account set up. Email me @nolen.scruggs@gmail.com for collabs!
